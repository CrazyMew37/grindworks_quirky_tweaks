# grindworks_quirky_tweaks
My personal mods for the Toontown: The Grindworks. All of these are Modloader Compatible.

## Clash Health Lights
Changes the health light colors of the cogs to be that of Toontown: Corporate Clash, more specifically based on Toontown: Project Altis' code. I don't think Clash changed the health colors aside from Overheal/Overcharge, so I think it's the same.

## Better Health Lights
An alternate version of making the cogs' HP colors more variable, this time using my own health color system. You can judge HP more easily this way, as instead of there being four/five different colors, there's now nineteen/twenty. You cannot use this mod alongside Clash Health Lights, so pick one.

## Better Haunted Cog Golf Course
This mod decreases the dark fog in the Haunted Cog Golf Course, reducing it by about 75%. Now you can actually see in this floor!

## Nerfed Fairway Fiend
Find the Fairway Fiend to be too fast or too hard? Then this mod is for you! This mod simply slows down the Fairway Fiend Golf Balls by decreasing their speed increase per mole. The increase in speed is now only about 44.4% of what it is in vanilla (pre-nerf).

## Nightlife Soundpack
This replaces the game's soundtrack with Toontown Nightlife, the content pack. This is intended to be paired with moose's texture pack, at least until they add music themselves.
