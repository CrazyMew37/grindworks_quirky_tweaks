# grindworks_quirky_tweaks
My personal mods for the Toontown: The Grindworks. All of these are Modloader Compatible.

### Clash Health Lights
Changes the health light colors of the cogs to be that of Toontown: Corporate Clash, more specifically based on Toontown: Project Altis' code. I don't think Clash changed the health colors aside from Overheal/Overcharge, so I think it's the same.

### Better Health Lights
An alternate version of making the cogs' HP colors more variable, this time using my own health color system. You can judge HP more easily this way, as instead of there being four/five different colors, there's now nineteen/twenty. You cannot use this mod alongside Clash Health Lights, so pick one.

### Better Haunted Cog Golf Course
This mod decreases the dark fog in the Haunted Cog Golf Course, reducing it by about 75%. Now you can actually see in this floor!

### Faster Luck Boost
Hate the Play Dead animation? Then replace it with this new animation where the Doodle magically phases through the floor and pops right out of solid ground! It's now much faster than 15 seconds of drama! May or may not be valid for speedruns.

### Yellow Mole Destroyer
Hate how the Yellow Moles keep launching you and bouncing you around like a tennis ball? Well, take your revenge with this mod that lets you stomp on the yellow moles! They now count in the mole game, so some adjustments were made accordingly. Mole games are now quintupled in required moles (This includes Fairway Fiend), and red moles are now worth 2 moles.

### Cog Creator Plus
This mod adds some extra utilities and uses for the Cog Creator, adding stuff like head positions, extended scales, an overhauled suit menu, and more. All cogs made with this mod should be vanilla compatible.

## DISCONTINUED MODS

### Nerfed Fairway Fiend (Latest Version is 1.1.3)
Find the Fairway Fiend to be too fast or too hard? Then this mod is for you! This mod simply slows down the Fairway Fiend Golf Balls by decreasing their speed increase per mole. The increase in speed is now only about 44.4% of what it is in vanilla (pre-nerf).

### Nightlife Soundpack (Latest Version is 1.1.3)
This replaces the game's soundtrack with Toontown Nightlife, the content pack. This is intended to be paired with moose's texture pack, at least until they add music themselves.
